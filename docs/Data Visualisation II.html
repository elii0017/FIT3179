      <h2>Australians in Custody</h2>
      <div>
        <div id="linedot" class="visualization"></div>
      </div>
        <p style="width": 50%;"> 
          In the recent June quarter, 44,051 individuals were in custody. An increase of 2% of 746 
          more individuals since the March quarter. 
          <br><br>
          Whilst the graph appears to "fluctuate" due to the y-axis starting at 40,000, this was done
          to better visualise the increase and decrease of custody numbers.
          <br><br>
          The lowest amount of Australians in custody between the periods
          of 2019 to 2024 was 40,330 in the March Quarter of 2022

      <h2>Australia's Daily Imprisonment Rate</h2>
      <div id="heat_map" class="visualization"></div>
      <p style="width": 40%;">
        Australia's Jun Qtr 2024 Imprisonment Rate was 208 persons per 100,000 in the adult population.
        The Northen Territory has the highest imprisonment rate (>1000) out of any other state or territory.
        The map does not display the change in March Qtr 2024 or June Qtr 2024 as it does not adequately display
        the change in daily imprisonment rates across each state.

      <div id="sidebars" class="visualization"></div>
      <p style="width": 40%;">
        The visualisation below provides a better understanding of Australia's Daily Imprisonment Rate.
        Overall, the data suggests that all states and territories have had a relativley stable daily imprisonment rate.

      <h2>2016-2024 Prisoner Reception</h2>
      <div id="line_chart" class="visualization"></div>
      <p>
        The drop in 2024 is due to data only available up to June.
        <br><br>
        The States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland appear to have the highest amount of prisoner receptions,
        this could be due to these states having a higher population compared to the rest.
        In general the Australian males, in particular non-indigenous males have the highest prisoner receptions.
        This trend is noted for almost all states and territories besides the Northern Territory.
        The Northern Territory experiences more prisoner receptions by Indigenous people.
        Some data was not published for certain quarters, as such the graph may show a larger decrease in a year

      <h2>Proportions of Male and Female Prisoners</h2>
      <div id="stacked_bar" class="visualization"></div>
      <p>
        Although there are 92% of males(40,578) and 8% of females(3,473) in prison,
        by normalising the data, we can see that the age brackets of female and male prisoners have similar trends.
        The age brackets of 25-34 and 35-44 appear to take roughly 60% to 65% of most prisoners.
        As the age bracket increases we observe a noticeable drop in percentages.
