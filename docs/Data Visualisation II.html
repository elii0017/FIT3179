          In the recent June quarter, 44,051 individuals were in custody. An increase of 2% of 746 
          more individuals since the March quarter. 
          <br><br>
          Whilst the graph appears to "fluctuate" due to the y-axis starting at 40,000, this was done
          to better visualise the increase and decrease of custody numbers.
          <br><br>
          The lowest amount of Australians in custody between the periods
          of 2019 to 2024 was 40,330 in the March Quarter of 2022

          The Northern Territory has the highest imprisonment rate (>1000) out of any other state or territory

          The visualisation below provides a better understanding of Australia's Daily Imprisonment Rate.

          The drop in 2024 is due to data only available up to June.
          <br><br>
          The States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland appear to have the highest amount of prisoner receptions,
          this could be due to these states having a higher population compared to the rest.
          <br><br>
          In general the Australian males, in particular non-indigenous males have the highest prisoner receptions.
          This trend is noted for almost all states and territories besides the Northern Territory.
          The Northern Territory experiences more prisoner receptions by Indigenous people.
          <br><br>
          Some data was not published for certain quarters, as such the graph may show a larger decrease in a year

        <p class="visualization-text">
          Although there are 92% of males(40,578) and 8% of females(3,473) in prison,
          by normalising the data, we can see that the age brackets of female and male prisoners have similar trends.
          <br><br>
          The age brackets of 25-34 and 35-44 appears to account for roughly 60% to 65% of most prisoners.
          <br><br>
          As the age bracket increases we observe a noticeable drop in percentages. This decrease could be due to 
          prisoners being released after serving their time or that it is less likely for people significantly older
          to commit crimes.

        <div id="pie_comparison" class="visualization"></div>
        <p class="visualization-text">
          From a quick glance we can observe that there are more Non-Indigenous than Indigenous prisoners. 
          We can see that from 2023 there was an increase of 1,694 Indigenous prisoners and a decrease of
          997 Non-Indigenous prisoners. 
          The visualisation below provides a better breakdown among among the demography of Indigenous and 
          Non-Indigenous prisoners.

        <p class = "visualization-container">
          By breaking it down further we can see that amongst Indigenous and Non-Indigenous prisoners
          that a similar trend exists for the age brackets. 
          What we can observe is that there are more crimes committed by youthful Indigenous between 
          the ages of 18-24.
